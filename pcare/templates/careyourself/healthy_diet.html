    <div> 
        <ul>
            <li>Eat well and choose healthy foods. Most pregnant women need to
                eat only 100-300 extra calories per day to support a baby’s
                growth. For example, if you eat 2 eggs and 2 corn tortillas, that’s
                about 300 calories. One medium-sized apple and 2 tablespoons of
                peanut butter is about 300 calories.</li>
            <li>Eat many different fresh foods daily, including vegetables, fruits,
                protein, grains, and dairy.</li>
            <li>Watch serving sizes. You may be eating more than you need to.
                Don’t eat for two! 100-300 extra calories is not that much.</li>
            <li>Stay away from doughnuts, chips, fast food, sodas, cookies, and
                candy. Junk foods and sweets don’t support your baby’s growth.</li>
            <li>Do not eat fish with high levels of mercury like shark, swordfish,
                king mackerel, tilefish, fresh or frozen tuna steaks, or orange roughy.</li>
            <li>Do not eat unpasteurized (raw) milk and cheeses. Bacteria in
                unpasteurized milk and cheese can be dangerous. If milk or
                cheese is pasteurized, that means the bacteria has been taken out.</li>
        </ul>
        <div>Stay away from soft cheeses like Mexican-style
        Queso Blanco or Fresco, Feta, or Brie. They are
        often unpasteurized.

        <ol>
            <li>When you cook, wash your hands and cooking surfaces often.</li>
            <li>Wash all fruits and vegetables before you eat them.</li>
            <li>Keep raw meat away from other food.</li>
            <li>Cook your food until it’s steaming hot. Put the food that you don’t eat in the refrigerator or the freezer.</li>
            <li>Never eat raw foods like meat, fish, shellfish, or eggs.</li>
        </ol>
